This is a normal text file.
Learning python is hectic.
today, I'm extra sleepy.

#open files for reading
f = open("lesson.txt")
f = open("lesson.txt",'r')

#for writing
f = open("lesson.txt",'w')

#for exclusive creation
f = open("lesson2.txt",'x') < creates a new file >

#for appending
f = open("lesson.txt",'a')

# opening in text mode 
f = open("lesson.txt",'t') < read and write text to the file >

# for updating
f = open("lesson.txt",'+')

#in binary mode
f = open("lesson.txt",'b') < can't read or write text >
